							<h2>Genetic Engineering</h2>
                            <p>Genetic Engineering is a game first invented by Alexey Pajitnov, the maker of Tetris, sometime in the 1980s.  The basic goal of the game is to try to find a way to fit all of the given tetrominoes onto a grid.  When Alexey made the game, he implemented it entriely in the terminal using C, probably in a very similar manner to how I implemented my game.</p>
                            <p>Despite the games simplicity, I found that it was actually fairly difficult to implement.  A proper, error free implementation requires a lot of careful thought and debugging.</p>
							<p>My code and some screenshots are attached below.  If you decide to play, I will warn you that even Alexey himself admitted the game was quite dull.</p>
